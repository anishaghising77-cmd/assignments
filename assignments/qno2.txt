If that program to find the roots of a quadratic equation runs but gives the incorrect output ,the error is a logical error.
correct way :(-b+sqrt(d))(2*a)

complication : The compiler takes the perprocessor code and translates it into assembly language.
             : This is the stage where syntax errors are caught.

execution : Once we have the .exe file , the execution phase begins.
          : This is the stage where runtime error/logical errors are caught.
